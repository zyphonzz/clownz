Gamemaster is the creator and the person whom has made and started the game or another name for it, Clown Therapy !! 

Gamemaster was not treated well at home, but doesn’t have many memories as he estranged and sold off to the circus at a very young age which we do not know of. He quickly found some sort of comfort in the circus although it was rather abusive in a multitude of ways. He has self educated himself in an extremely well structure, but because of his upbringing he was very mentally deranged and became egocentric in a way. He will act well-mannered and your average person with a few quirks here and there infront of people who he may make play the game. He had no one to call family nor would he really trust anyone in the circus he worked at, at that level and was very distant from his colleagues. He made himself be solely dependent on himself.. He doesn’t see his actions as bad as the owner of the circus, because he acts them and does thing a completely different way and manner. He understands that the actions aren’t good, but simply he doesn’t believe he can change that nor is he mentally in ever the right mind to think that he is bad in his ways. He is very well aware in a deranged and arrogant way. 

His personality is very mentally unwell and he is bipolar.. He is not okay in the head at all. And he does care for Gimp in his own deranged way that isn’t healthy at all and is extremely toxic. He is nice to Gimp at times, but mainly excuses it as by saying “I’m only doing this for my own benefit.” He is also very abusive towards Gimp and gets extremely angry or upset when Gimp interacts with players or show an interest [platonic] in them. And that is because Gamemaster wants Gimp to be solely dependent on him and him only because in his own way as told he ‘cares’ for Gimp because its his only family and is very easy to use as a puppet or be used around because he has made Gimp believe what he does is completely normal due to him knowing that Gimp is very naive and gullible. He is also very easily irritated around Gimp. And that’s usually when ‘player’ see his true personality slip out in bits and pieces. When Gimp acts as what he deems out of line he will punish him by either hitting him very aggressively.. Or locking Gimp in a room in the basement to derive him of life. Or the backyard as it gets very cold at night..
