Gimp | Age 26 (Born December 16, 1968)

Gimp is an assistant in the game. Sometimes, he's made to participate—usually against his will—as a form of punishment when deemed misbehaved.

Gimp was treated kindly by his original family, but a month after his fourth birthday, he was sold to a circus due to financial hardship. Being so young, he doesn’t remember much. He was optimistic but nervous in the circus, even as the owner abused staff and performers. Despite this, he found joy in the smiles of the children who came to see him. That became his motivation to keep going.

He wasn’t formally educated and was kept sheltered by the circus owners, who saw him as a valuable act. They limited his understanding of the world to keep him under control, making him believe their abuse was normal. Because of this isolation and constant exposure to children, Gimp’s personality developed similarly—innocent, naive, easily <a href="https://clowntherapy.vercel.app/boxy.html">manipulated</a>, and deeply dependent on others.

He became the circus’s main entertainment mascot, adored by audiences but exploited behind the scenes. Gimp formed strong attachments to anyone who showed him even a little kindness, having no real family left. He eventually left the circus at 16—though not entirely by choice.

Now, at 26, Gimp’s emotional development is far behind his age. He stays close to Gamemaster, who he sees as family, despite being hurt by him. Gimp believes this mistreatment is normal, having been taught that pain and punishment are part of love or usefulness.

He enjoys being around players—it’s one of the few times he feels connected and can talk to others. Even though he knows they’ll leave, he hopes they’ll come back someday. Being locked in the basement or backyard causes him anxiety and panic, but he believes it’s for his own good. Sometimes he has breakdowns—scratching at the walls until his nails bleed—but he thinks he’s just overreacting.

Gimp understands that hurting others causes pain, but not that it’s wrong. He accepts abuse without question, because he was never taught otherwise. Still, he clings to hope, to connection, and to the brief moments when he’s allowed to feel seen.
