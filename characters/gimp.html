Gimp is a sheltered, naive assistant who was sold to a circus as a child and raised in isolation. Though mistreated, he found joy in entertaining others and became the main attraction. His lack of proper education and social exposure left him emotionally stunted and easily manipulated. Now 26, he remains loyal to the Gamemaster, whom he sees as family despite the abuse. Gimp is eager to socialize with players and views even harmful treatment as normal, shaped by a lifetime of manipulation and confinement.
